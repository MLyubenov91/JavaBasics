The "Programming Basics" course provides the foundational programming skills necessary for all tech specialties at SoftUni. This includes writing basic code, working with an integrated development environment (IDE), using variables and data, operators and expressions, working with the console (reading input and printing results), and using conditional statements (if and if-else) and loops (for and while).
